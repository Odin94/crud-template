## Frontend Template


## Routing 
* The tanstack router is initialized in `main.tsx`
* Props are passed to route components via the `routeState.ts` utility
* Wrapper components in `RouteWrappers.tsx` handle the prop injection
* Navigation uses TanStack Router's `Link` component for optimal performance
